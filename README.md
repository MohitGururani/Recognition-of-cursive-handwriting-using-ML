# Title: Cursive Handwriting Recognition using Machine Learning

Description:
This GitHub repository provides an implementation of cursive handwriting recognition using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the pyscreenshot and cv2 libraries to capture screenshots, preprocess them for digit recognition, and display the results using OpenCV.

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient system capable of recognizing handwritten digits in cursive writing. Cursive handwriting poses unique challenges due to its varied styles and continuous nature, making it more challenging to analyze and recognize compared to printed text.

# Key Features:

Cursive handwriting screenshot capture: The project uses the pyscreenshot library to capture screenshots of cursive handwriting samples. This allows users to provide their own handwritten digits for recognition.
Preprocessing and feature extraction: The captured screenshots are processed using various techniques such as image resizing, noise reduction, and segmentation to extract relevant features for digit recognition.
Machine learning model: The project employs a machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), to learn from the extracted features and classify the handwritten digits.
Results visualization: OpenCV is utilized to display the recognized digits alongside the original handwritten samples, providing a visual representation of the recognition performance.

Contributions and enhancements to the project are welcome. If you have ideas or improvements to make, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues on the GitHub repository.
